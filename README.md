Machine learning is a crucial part of modern software development. Libraries
like pandas, scikit-learn, gensim, and Theano help developers build projects
that were previously impossible, and these applications empower our users and
can make fundamental improvements in daily life. This talk will show you the
why, what, and how of machine learning in Python.

Abstract
========
Machine learning is a huge part of modern computing - from Facebook
auto-tagging, spam rejection, and Google searches to robotic cars, predictive
healthcare, and phones that can warn you about traffic jams before leaving
work, machine learning is everywhere. These tools enhance our lives, and
understanding what machine learning can (and can't) do is crucial to modern
software development.

Thanks to the amazing Python ecosystem, it is not necessary to have deep
knowledge of the mathematical techniques and statistics behind machine learning
in order to use these algorithms in your daily work or hobby projects.
Libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, gensim, and Theano help developers build
projects that were previously impossible, and these applications empower our
users and can make fundamental improvements to daily life.

This talk will show you the why, what, and how of machine learning in Python.
